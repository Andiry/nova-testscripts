These are some useful scripts for running mongoDB with YCSB.

To setup YCSB :

1. git clone the YCSB repo from here - https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB
2. The mongodb directory has instructions of how to setup and use mongoDB with YCSB.

For async mode, follow the following command :

 > bash cmds.sh
 
 This script does the follows :
 
 1. It runs the async mode for mongoDB with differet number of threads : from 1 t 64.
 Thread counts used - 1 2 4 8 16 24 32 64
 2. The results from load and run phase are saved in files named asyncLoad and asyncRun respectively.
 3. It runs getNum.pl on asyncLoad and asyncRun to get the following results :
 
 Load Throughput (in ops/sec) 
 Run Throughput (in ops/sec)
 Read AverageLatency  (in microseconds)
 Read 99thPercentileLatency (in microseconds)
 Update AverageLatency  (in microseconds)
 Update 99thPercentileLatency (in microseconds)
 
 These results are printed into the file named "results" in a single line as follows:
 
 Example : 944.2870632672333	966.1835748792271	832.6686868686869	1141.0	751.9584158415842	1163.0
 
 where each column corressponds to the data label shown above
 i.e. The load throughput is 944.2870632672333 ops/sec etc.
 
 Each line in the "results" file corresponds to the number of threads.
 
 To run the sync mode, just change the command from " bash async_cmds.sh"  to "bash sync_cmds.sh" in the script cmds.sh
