This is an RFC patch series that impements NOVA (NOn-Volatile memory
Accelerated file system), a new file system built for PMEM.

NOVA's goal is to provide a high-performance, full-featured, production-ready
file system tailored for byte-addressable non-volatile memories (e.g., NVDIMMs
and Intel's soon-to-be-released 3DXpoint DIMMs).  It combines design elements
from many other file systems to provide a combination of high-performance,
strong consistency guarantees, and comprehensive data protection.  NOVA supports
DAX-style mmap, and making DAX perform well is a first-order priority in NOVA's
design.

NOVA was developed at the Non-Volatile Systems Laboratory in the Computer
Science and Engineering Department at the University of California, San Diego.
Its primary authors are Andiry Xu <jix024@eng.ucsd.edu>, Lu Zhang
<luzh@eng.ucsd.edu>, and Steven Swanson <swanson@eng.ucsd.edu>.

NOVA is stable enough to run complex applications, but there is substantial
work left to do.  This RFC is intended to gather feedback to guide its
development toward eventual inclusion upstream.

The patches are relative Linux 4.12.

Overview
========

NOVA is primarily a log-structured file system, but rather than maintain a
single global log for the entire file system, it maintains separate logs for
each file (inode).  NOVA breaks the logs into 4KB pages, they need not be
contiguous in memory.  The logs only contain metadata.

File data pages reside outside the log, and log entries for write operations
point to data pages they modify.  File modification uses copy-on-write (COW) to
provide atomic file updates.

For file operations that involve multiple inodes, NOVA use small, fixed-sized
redo logs to atomically append log entries to the logs of the inodes involved.

This structure keeps logs small and makes garbage collection very fast.  It also
enables enormous parallelism during recovery from an unclean unmount, since
threads can scan logs in parallel.

NOVA replicates and checksums all metadata structures and protects file data
with RAID-4-style parity.  It supports checkpoints to facilitate backups.

Documentation/filesystems/NOVA.txt contains some lower-level implementation and
usage information.  A more thorough discussion of NOVA's goals and design is
